Description: Using this table you can override the animations for certain stances for specific avatars.

Columns:
STANCE - the stance ID to override
OVERRIDE - the stance ID to use instead

Rows:
Each row can be used to override one stance for one animation. If you need to override multiple stances for the same animations, add one row for each override.

Example:
(Kobold from BG1 - don't use ATTACK_JAB because that animation is for SHOOT)
0x8200     13         12
