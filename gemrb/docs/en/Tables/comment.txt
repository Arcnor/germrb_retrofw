Description: This table lists the association of verbal constants with area type flags.
The order is important.


AREAFLAG - the area flag bit (PST has special flags, otherwise the games are pretty much the same)
VC       - the verbal constant associated with the area flag
SWITCH   - marks the day/night bit, if it is set to 1, then there are different messages for day and night
